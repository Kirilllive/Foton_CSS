# Foton CSS & HTML

A collection of web page components using pure CSS and HTML without JavaScript. With their help, you can create a small portfolio page or landing website.

For security reasons, many users disable JavaScript in their browsers. I often create small documentation websites where easy navigation and often offline functionality are crucial, and without scripting and back-end this is no easy task. So, I decided to gather all my experience in creating interactive websites without JS in one place.

I've observed that many developers rely too heavily on JavaScript when creating interfaces and often implement functionality that is already available in HTML and CSS without additional scripting.
