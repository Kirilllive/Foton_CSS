# The site is only in HTML & CSS
It often happens that users disable JavaScript in their browser for security reasons. So, I tried to create a full-fledged business card website using only HTML and CSS, without JavaScript or server.

This system can be used as a basis for small business card websites, portfolios, documentation, and other resources that require convenient offline use.
