# Foton CSS & HTML

Hi! My name is Kirill Live, and I develop web applications for creativity and work.

For security reasons, many users disable JavaScript in their browsers. I often create small documentation sites where easy navigation and often offline functionality are essential. So, I decided to gather all my experience in creating interactive websites without JS in one place.

I've observed that many developers rely too heavily on JavaScript when creating interfaces and often implement functionality that is already available in HTML and CSS without additional scripting. CSS has evolved significantly over the past 20 years, and I plan to collect examples of its capabilities here:
